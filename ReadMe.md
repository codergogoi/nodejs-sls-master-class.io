## NodeJS Microservice Master Class

A complete production-level project tutorial of NodeJS Microservice with Serverless technology. Through this series, you will gain professional-level knowledge of build and deploying an enterprise-level application using NodeJS. This series will give you a good understanding of going from scratch to production using AWS infrastructure using infrastructure as code.

This series follows the SOLID principle with a CQRS design pattern, and clean architecture and every bit of coding and step is self-explanatory.

### Road Map:

Front end part will be available in mid of December to hookup with all microservices.

    Note: As you know CodeWithJay is Backend focus channel so you can only expect bare minimum explanation on FE part. There are lot of good people teaching Front end Tutorials which be far better than my FE skills :)
